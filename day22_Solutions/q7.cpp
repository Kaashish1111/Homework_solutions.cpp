// 7: What is Byte addressable?

// Byte-addressable refers to a memory architecture where each individual byte (8 bits) of memory has its own unique address. In this architecture, the smallest unit of data that can be directly accessed (read from or written to) is a single byte.

// In contrast, there are other memory architectures where the smallest addressable unit is larger than a byte. For example, some systems may have word-addressable memory, where each address corresponds to a larger unit of data (e.g., 4 bytes or more).

// Byte-addressable memory is common in modern computer systems and is advantageous because it allows for fine-grained control over memory operations and efficient handling of data structures that may not align perfectly with larger addressable units. It also simplifies programming by providing direct access to individual bytes, which is often necessary for tasks involving character data, strings, and small data types.
